# ScriptersCF Gamejam Information
*The following information only applies to events that don't require participants to install a plugin.*

## Introduction
A game jam is an event where you have to make a game based on a theme in a specified amount of time, which is usually 24 hours at ScriptersCF. After completing and submitting your game, it will be judged by a pre-selected team of judges which will then be compared with the other submissions. The developer(s) behind the best game receives a prize derived from donations which has previously gone up to **125,000R$**.

## Preparation
First, you need to decide whether you want to participate as a solo developer or with a team of developers. If you want to find a team and potentially make new friends during the process, you can use the `#game-jam-chat` channel to discuss what you are looking for. Once you have decided who you will work with, you **must** DM the event host with a team name (if applicable) and the Discord usernames of all participants.
Once registered, you might find it useful to get to know your team, and discuss the times that you will be available during the event.
