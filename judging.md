### How will the winners be determined?
⚠️ Note: This may be subject to change.

- At the end of the event, we will have prepared a select team of judges that will play each game thoroughly.
- The judges will be taking the following factors into consideration:
    - Is your game relevant to the theme?
    - Does your game offer an enjoyable experience?
    - How playable is your game? Any issues?
    - How much gameplay is there to experience?
    - How aesthetically pleasing is your game?
    - What do the team think of the game overall?
- Next, the judges will collectively determine their **top 5** favourite games.
- Finally, the results will be determined by a community vote of these top 5 games.
    - New members will not be able to vote, in effort to prevent cheating.
